A Random User Generator and a Homer J Simpson Ipsum Generator!

I used some Bootstrap themes I found online as a starting point and then I modified them heavily.

For the Homer J Ipsum I found a long list of Homer quotes that I compiled into a list.

For the User Generator I am use profile images from a website that creates avatars on the fly.

I am also using a random name generator package that I found from packagist.
